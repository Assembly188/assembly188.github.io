- Each vertical section is a markdown file in **_posts/** directory.
  * They're sorted by 'date'. (we don't use date anywhere, it only sorts)
- Each vertical section sets it's own **color**, **header icon** (or image), **title**, and easy-to-write markdown body.
- Only **two things** to edit:
  1. Edit `_config.yml` to set the site title, description, etc
  2. Add `_posts/*.md` to make each vertical section. Copy some examples and add the sections from your README.md for a fast start!
- Easy adding of **SEO terms**, **favicon** & such, and **google analytics token**.

Sound good? Let's go!

2. Make a [**standalone project**](#setup-as-standalone-project-page) page
3. Make a [site under an **existing project**](#setup-inside-existing-project)
